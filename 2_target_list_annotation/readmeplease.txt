#### DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS

"data/lin_all.merge.ins.bedgraph"
### ATAC seq annotation file  ### 
#### Raw reads were downloaded from Schep et al. 2015 paper and mapped to sacCer3. Then the bedgraph is generated by "pyatac ins --bam" ####

"data/WT.polyA.forward.depth"
"data/WT.polyA.reverse.depth"
#### Annotation : RNA transcription (strand-specific RNA-seq) ####
#### BAM files of the WT samples with polyA enrichment were generated using the raw data from Venkatesh et al. 2016 ####
#### Forward strand and reverse strand reads were stratified using "samtools view -bf 16" and "samtools view -bF 16", and then calculated depth per base using "samtools depth".

#### Annotation : Histone modifications ####
#### BW annotation files were downloaded from Weiner et al. 2015 and transformed into per-base signal intensities ####
#### and were then transform into binned values (100 bp windows of 50bp step) ####
